    <p>Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.<br>
        I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.<br>
        The evil that men do lives after them;<br>
        The good is oft interred with their bones.<br>
        So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus<br>
        Hath told you Caesar was ambitious.<br>
        If it were so, it was a grievous fault,<br>
        And grievously hath Caesar answered it.<br>
        Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest<br>
        (For Brutus is an honorable man;<br>
        So are they all, all honorable men),<br>
        Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.<br>
        He was my friend, faithful and just to me,<br>
        But Brutus says he was ambitious,<br>
        And Brutus is an honorable man.<br>
        He hath brought many captives home to Rome,<br>
        Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill.<br>
        Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?<br>
        When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept;<br>
        Ambition should be made of sterner stuff.<br>
        Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,<br>
        And Brutus is an honorable man.<br>
        You all did see that on the Lupercal<br>
        I thrice presented him a kingly crown,<br>
        Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?<br>
        Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,<br>
        And sure he is an honorable man.<br>
        I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,<br>
        But here I am to speak what I do know.<br>
        You all did love him once, not without cause.<br>
        What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?--<br>
        O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,<br>
        And men have lost their reason!--Bear with me;<br>
        My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,<br>
        And I must pause till it come back to me.</p>
